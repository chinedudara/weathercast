# weathercast
A weather time machine built on nodeJs

For now this is a CLI app. I'm gradually building a minimalist GUI for the app using reactJs.

Two APIs were used:
* Google Geocode Api
* Darksky Weather Api


---App Commands---

node app -a "Location Address"

-a "Address to fetch weather for"
-v app version
-h help
